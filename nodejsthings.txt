 
the command above is for connecting to the database
npm run dev ( dependencies in package.json file .. for launching the server)
`

a lot of libraries and method : 
link to doc : https://mongoosejs.com/docs/

-express module for lanching pages on the server , with the index.js appropriate files and hbs for loading pages(dinamically)

-mongoose (module)
-findIdByname...
-find...
-findoAndDelete../update...others..
-modules...
-check on api, model, queries in guides..


-httpsstatuses.com // for status page result after a request of a page

for password encrypt

-bcryptjs module

-middlewear for manage behaviour of module, u can find it on mongoose doc 
-validate, save.... (events)




in models we have just the models of the table in the database, in routers we manage operations on that table
but if we want to use middlewear we have to do some changes to the code, so the terminal print the middlewear console.log we wrote before


for regular expression :
regex101.com:
\. is for serching string .. e.g. : \.doc after the $ character is for at the end of the string, not in the middle 
the | means this expression or this one .. so : \.(doc|docs)$ search for string that has at the end doc or docs


we use npm i mudule --save-dev for saving the module locally, so when we need it locally and not installed by depencencies

we have to add in package.json under dev field under dev proprieties this following : 'env-cmd ./config/dev.env' .... nodemon src/index.js

password for mongoDB Atlas : passWORD1

for git config : 
git config  user.email "pinnapinna@hotmail.it"
git config  user.name "Roberto"
git config --local -l

with heroku : 
heroku create pinna-task-manager --> this name has to be unique in the world

to push : git push heroku master

for adding test : open package.json and write under scipts proprieties : "test" : "jest"
we have to install jest before that 
run test
after, he said to add in : "test" : "jest --watch" to add some options ( in real time.. compile time)
for tests : https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect
	    https://mochajs.org/

notice that in test.env and dev.env we have the same written so are the same file, except for the name of the database, bc everytime i launch a test i don't
want to that the test write on my database, so i change the database name so it populate another database

for adding now the config customize option we have to add inside package.json under test : 
"env-cmd ./config/test.env jest --watch"
we need also to add jest proprieties


--runInBand in package.json under test  .. jest... it serves for running my tests in series making sure they don't overlap or conflicts.

--save-dev for install a package as a development dependency
