please remember that trying that application on localhost could not work , it will say u cannot get localhost... on fetch function , bc in fact for localhost issue... try on heroku.

enjoy.


remember that for coordinates setup u have to trigger start function in super_user

u can go on from device setupping made , just have to launch some function on localhost pc that received the parameters to start the device ;)




remember about sockets : 
- socket.broadcast.emit  --> will send data to others client , different from the coming one ( u need it for this purpose, can't use emit)

- socket.emit -> will send data just to the client who sent she request, just to him
